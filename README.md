# chrome-bookmarklet-manager
Chrome extension to get bookmarklets from a github repo and give you an easy way to use them

# TODO
* Create toggle to turn it on/off (what if a bookmarklet broke something???)
* How will the user configure which github repo holds their fancy bookmarklets?
* Create UI to show the library of bookmarklets once integrated
* Minify/uglify the code? Is it necessary?
* What file structure is good?
